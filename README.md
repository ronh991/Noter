# Noter 
Noter is an add-on created to increase productivity in Blender by organizing the workflow.

---

With Noter you can:

* Annotate a specific object,  scene or file(.blend).

* Save the text in the Blender itself so that it will be available in any file(.blend).

* Create note system using nodes. Thus, you can do something like a schema that will represent a chain of actions, for example, for one user or for the second if you work in a team.

* Enable Noter Splash Screen for file(.blend) so as not to forget if there is anything unfinished left when you open a file(.blend).


Noter can be divided into several parts:

* <a href="#main_panel">Main Panel</a>
* <a href="#splash_screen">Splash Screen</a>
* <a href="#notes_tree">Notes Tree</a>
* <a href="#notes_list">Notes List</a>

## <a name="main_panel">Main Panel</a>
location : Text Editor > Sidebar > Noter Tab

At the top is the string for the file name. The default value is "Text".

---

## <a name="splash_screen">Splash Screen</a>
The splash screen must be activated first. Then you need to save the file(.blend) and the next time you open the file(.blend) a splash screen will appear in a certain place (the position of the splash screen can be configured in the add-on preferences)

---

## <a name="notes_tree">Notes Tree</a>

location: Editor Type > Notes Tree

## <a name="notes_list">Notes List</a>

There are two lists in total: for the object and for the scene.
